DESCRIPTION:
Given an array of integers, find the one that appears an odd number of times.

There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times.

Examples
[7] should return 7, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
[0] should return 0, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
[1,1,2] should return 2, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
[0,1,0,1,0] should return 0, because it occurs 3 or 2 times (which is odd).
[1,2,2,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,4,4,2,2,1] should return 4, because it appears 3 time (which is odd).
[1,6,51,2,23,5,1,2,6,1,23,51,1] should return 5, because it appears 1 time (which is odd).
